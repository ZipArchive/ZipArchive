# New ZipArchive release

The following steps should be taken by project maintainers when they create a new release.

1. Create a new release and tag for the release.

    - Tags should be in the form of Major.Minor.Revision 
    
     *(Xcode SPM tools do not pick up vMajor.Minor.Revision used in older releases. After 2.4.2 please do not include the v in the tag name)*

    - Release names should be  more human readable: Version Major.Minor.Revision

2. Update the podspec and test it

    - *pod lib lint SSZipArchive.podspec*

3. Push the pod to the trunk

    - *pod trunk push SSZipArchive.podspec*


Note: We are no longer releasing a Carthage release as of 2.2.3. Developers are encouraged to build one themselves.


# Minizip-ng (formally minizip) update

The following steps should be taken by project maintainers when they update minizip files.

1. Source is at https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng.
2. Have cmake:
`brew install cmake`
3. Run cmake on minizip repo with our desired configuration:
`cmake . -DMZ_BZIP2=OFF -DMZ_LZMA=OFF`
4. Look at the file `./CMakeFiles/minizip.dir/DependInfo.cmake` it will give you the following information:
- The list of C files that we need to include.

Note: It will suggest we include libcomp and that only works on macos 10.11 and up, so the .c and .h file should not be included until we bump the min os versions.

5. Look at the file `./CMakeFiles/minizip.dir/flags.make` it will give you the following information:

- The list of compiler flags that we need to include 

Note: These should not be changed unless you have issues compiling or we bump the min os versions. 

HAVE_INTTYPES_H HAVE_PKCRYPT HAVE_STDINT_H HAVE_WZAES HAVE_ZLIB

With the exception of the last two: "MZ_ZIP_SIGNING" "_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L"

With later version of minizip it will want to switch to libcomp it will suggest we include libcomp and that only works on macos 10.11 and up.

6. Set those flags in SSZipArchive.podspec (for CocoaPods) and in ZipArchive.xcodeproj (for Carthage)
7. Replace the .h and .c files with the latest ones, except for `mz_compat.h`, which is customized to expose some struct in SSZipCommon.h and to provide support for optional aes.

Note: we can also use `cmake -G Xcode . -DMZ_BZIP2=OFF -DMZ_LZMA=OFF` to get the list of files to include in an xcodeproj of its own, from where we can remove unneeded `zip.h` and `unzip.h`.
